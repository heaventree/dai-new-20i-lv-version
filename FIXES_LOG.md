### FAQ questions to add via admin panel at `/admin/cms-pages/9/edit`:

1. **General Questions** — Q: *Will this affect my driving licence or will DAI report me to the NDLS?* — A: *DAI does not report directly to the NDLS. The final decision about your licence rests with your referring Healthcare Professional and the NDLS, not DAI. Our role is to provide an objective, professional assessment. Our goal is always to support safe driving where possible.*
2. **General Questions** — Q: *Is it a pass or fail test?* — A: *No — it is not a pass or fail test. It is a professional assessment that evaluates your current driving ability. The outcome is a detailed report with recommendations, not a pass or fail result.*
3. **Pricing** — Q: *How much does it cost and what is included?* — A: *The assessment fee is €235. This includes the full on-road driving assessment, a detailed written report, and recommendations for your Healthcare Professional. Please check our cancellation policy before booking.*
4. **Preparation** — Q: *What do I need to bring?* — A: *Please bring your valid driving licence, your Eircode, and confirmation of your current motor insurance, NCT, and motor tax. These details will also be required during the booking process.*
5. **General Questions** — Q: *Whose car is used during the assessment?* — A: *Your own car is used during the assessment. Please ensure it is taxed, insured, and has a valid NCT.*
